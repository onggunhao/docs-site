## Intro

[Binance Chain]() is a blockchain developed by [Binance]() and its community that implements a vision of a decentralized exchange (DEX) for digital assets.

At the heart of Binance Chain is a highly performant [matching engine]() built on [distributed consensus]() that aims to replicate the <1 second trading efficiency of current centralized exchanges.

Binance Chain transactions burns [BNB]() (the native token of the Binance ecosystem), according to a fee schedule.

Binance Chain also includes efforts to implement [listing assets from other chains](cross-chain-atomic-swaps), and cryptographic primitives such as [threshold signatures](threshold-signature-scheme).

## Functionality

Binance Chain has the basic features of most blockchains:

- Sending and receiving BNB and digital assets
- Issuing new digital assets (we have a standard called BEP-2)
- Mint/burn, freeze/unfreeze, lock/unlock of digital assets

It has DEX and trading-specific functionality:

- Propose exchange listing for trading pairs
- Creating maker/taker orders for traders
- Listing assets from other chains using atomic swaps (BEP-3)

Binance Chain also implements new features, such as

- Threshold Signatures (an alternative to multisig)
- Smart Contracts sidechain (in-progress)

## Participate

There are different ways to participate in the network, from light nodes to full validators.

Binance Chain follows a philosophy of progressive decentralization. We envision a future where organizations and individuals can run validator nodes, and BNB can be staked to join governance.
