[Binance Chain](https://www.binance.org) is a blockchain developed by [Binance](https://www.binance.com) and its community, that implements a vision of a decentralized exchange (DEX) for digital assets. It features a highly performant [matching engine](../concepts/matching-engine) built on [distributed consensus](../concepts/architecture) that aims to replicate the <1 second trading efficiency of current centralized exchanges.

Binance Chain transactions burns [BNB]() (the native token of the Binance ecosystem), according to a fee schedule.

## Innovation

Binance Chain implements innovative new technologies to push the cryptocurrency industry forward. This includes:

- Atomic swaps to [listing assets from other chains](cross-chain-atomic-swaps)
- Cryptographic primitives to improve security such as [threshold signatures](threshold-signature-scheme).

## Functionality

Binance Chain has the basic features of most blockchains:

- Sending and receiving BNB and digital assets
- Issuing new digital assets (we have a standard called BEP-2)
- Mint/burn, freeze/unfreeze, lock/unlock of digital assets

It has DEX and trading-specific functionality:

- Propose exchange listing for trading pairs
- Creating maker/taker orders for traders
- Listing assets from other chains using atomic swaps (BEP-3)

Binance Chain also implements new features, such as

- Threshold Signatures (an alternative to multisig)
- Smart Contracts sidechain (in-progress)

## Participate

There are different ways to participate in the network, from light nodes to full validators.

Binance Chain embraces a philosophy of progressive decentralization, and envisions a future where BNB can be staked by organizations and individuals to participate in governance and run validator nodes.
